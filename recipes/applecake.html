    <h2 class="ing">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (90g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (24g) King Arthur Almond Flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cup (160g) light brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 apples, peeled and sliced about 1/4" thick (4 1/2 cups or 550g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="ing">Method</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. </li>

        <li>Lightly grease the bottom of an 8" or 9" springform pan or round cake pan (this will help the parchment adhere), then line the bottom with a parchment round. Generously butter the parchment and sides of the pan with the softened butter. Sprinkle with the sliced almonds, a bit at a time, pressing gently to adhere them to the pan. Your coating won’t be perfectly even, and that’s OK. </li>

        <li>Weigh your flours; or measure them by gently spooning into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, and salt.  

        </li>

        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, sugar, and extract until creamy, lighter in color, and slightly foamy, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk in the dry ingredients until just combined.</li>

        <li>Use a rubber spatula to fold the apples into the batter until evenly coated. (It will look like there isn’t much batter, but don’t panic.) </li>

        <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and use your spatula to nudge the apples into a mostly-even layer. </li>

        <li>Bake until golden-brown on top and a toothpick or paring knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 to 55 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack. Run a paring knife or offset spatula around the edges of pan, then, if using a springform, release sides of pan; or, if using a cake pan, invert it onto a rack or plate, remove the parchment, and turn it back over, top-side up, onto a wire rack. Let cool for at least 15 minutes more. For the neatest pieces, slice with a sharp serrated knife, which will help you saw through the apple pieces rather than crushing them. </li>

        <li>Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing, using a palette knife.</li>
